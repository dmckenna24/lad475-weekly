Hi!  I'm Lauren, and I'm currently a junior at NYU.  I'm planning on pursuing the 5 year BA/MS in Computer Science right now as well!

### Programming Interests

Despite my ever changing decisions on which topic I'll pursue in the field, my current interests lie in web development, particularly full stack development.  I'm looking forward to contributing to different open source JavaScript libraries that I've used!

There are also a few other projects that are music related that I've used before and hope to contribute to at some point this semester, since music has always been another key interest of mine.

### A bit more about me

I'm from Long Island, New York, and I enjoy reading books, creative writing, making art, playing video games, and playing music- more specifically, my favorite instrument, the double bass.  I classically trained in bass for nearly 10 years and piano for 4.

Did I also mention I love coffee?  If you don't know where to find me, chances are I'm at some kind of cafe around Manhattan.  Not only do I just love coffee though, I love both cooking and (of course!) eating food as well!
